# newsletter-signup-project
This project builds a web app that allows people to sign up to a newsletter in Nodejs using Mailchimp API.
### Overview
This web app sets up a newsletter where you want to email people who are interested in hearing from you.<br><br> 
It's a single page website that looks incredibly simple on the frontend, but on the backend it has got some powerful
functionality that allows you to sign people up to your mailing list.
### Usage & Features
* Once the sign up form is filled and the button is clicked, if it is successful, then people get taken to the success page
and if it isn't, then they will get a failure page.
* The data provided by people gets sent to your list on Mailchimp account and all of that data gets added into your list as well as
 the new subscriber.
 * After these two steps, you can go ahead and send your newsletters and email campaigns to your subscribers.
